# Machine-Learning-Models 
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks with implementations of different ML models. For every Model there is an example with sklearn and an implementation from scratch to better understand the algorithm. 

At the top of each Notebook I linked the sources I used. My main source is [sentdex's machine learning tutorial](https://pythonprogramming.net/machine-learning-tutorial-python-introduction/).  Some Notebooks have contain notes for further understanding of the algorithms

List of ML models that have been implemented:
+ Linear regression
+ K nearest neighbors
+ Support vector machine
+ Decision Tree
+ K Means
+ Mean shift
